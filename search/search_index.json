Being discord.com-compatible will allow all existing clients, bots, and applications written for discord.com to be used on any Spacebar instance, which we believe will be immensely useful for any transition process between services.</p> <p>As Spacebar is an entirely separate service from discord.com, it means a Spacebar server by itself cannot access private data controlled by discord.com. You cannot use a Spacebar server to chat with your friends on discord.com. You also cannot use a Spacebar server to grant premium (\"Nitro\") features to a discord.com account (although you can grant these to a Spacebar account).</p> <p>Our goal is to achieve complete feature parity with discord.com, as well as implement additional security, privacy, and other useful features serverside. In addition to our server software, we aim to create Spacebar-aware clients that can be used to connect to multiple Spacebar-compatible instances with rich theming and plugin support.</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>For any kind of support regarding Spacebar, feel free to ask questions in our discord.com guild or our official Spacebar instance.</p> <p>For bug reporting and feature requests please create an issue on Github.</p>"},{"location":"faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","text":"Is Spacebar still in development? Production Ready? <p>Yes, Spacebar is still in development. Our unpaid team of volunteers is very small though, and so progress is very dependant on our motivation and outside life.</p> <p>The Spacebar server program has been in development since at least 28/11/2020, and has most core features implemented. API compatibility is reasonable although not quite perfect and so some third party clients may not function, although the official Discord.com client which we test against functions correctly for the most part.</p> <p>The big Discord.com features currently left unimplemented or with partial implementations are:</p> <ul> <li>Voice/Video support (WebRTC protocol support implemented, but lacking UDP protocol implementation)</li> <li>Voice activities</li> <li>OAuth2 scopes and other applications (Bot applications work by are left unscoped)</li> <li>Message threads</li> <li>Pomelo (new username system without discriminators)</li> <li>Auto moderation</li> </ul> <p>For a more complete overview of what is left unimplemented, please refer to the missing routes viewer</p> <p>The Spacebar client however is very premature, starting development around 1/03/2023. It is not ready production use or as your daily driver. It lacks many core features and is not recommended to be used. Please setup a third party client, or help contribute to our codebase! Any and all help is appreciated.</p> How do you use the Client? <p>As described in Clients, the official client is not ready yet. You are free to use a Spacebar compatible client to connect, but no support will be provided.</p> Voice/Video when? <p>Currently there is experimental voice/video WebRTC support in Spacebar. UDP connections are not currently supported.</p> <p>This is a very difficult feature to get working, especially given that we must implement it the exact same way as Discord.com for client compatibility, so if you find any bugs please open an issue in Spacebar server.</p> <p>We would also be incredibly thankful for any assistance.</p> Free Nitro? <p>Please do not use Discord trademarks to refer to anything regarding Spacebar. As an instance owner, you can grant yourself or others premium features which may be used to determine your abilities client-side. However, Spacebar-server currently does not have any distinction between premium and free users. All users can access all features, given they have the rights to do so.</p> <p>You cannot give yourself premium features on Discord.com using a Spacebar instance.</p> How do I boost my guild? Or, how do I buy premium? <p>You cannot buy premium features through Spacebar, as Spacebar does not support any payment backend.</p> <p>Additionally, Spacebar does not currently have any distinction between premium and free users or guilds. All users and guilds have access to all features server-side.</p> <p>In the case of users, you may run into issues with the client preventing you from using certain features, if the user's <code>premium_type</code> or <code>premium</code> values are not set correctly. By default, Spacebar will do this for you, however.</p> <p>In the case of guilds, you may run into issues with uploading animated icons or banners, etc. If so, simply give the guild the features you require. You can set them to be given to all guilds by default using the config <code>guild_defaultFeatures</code> array.</p> Can I log in with my Discord account? <p>No. Spacebar and Discord are entirely separate services, with their own separate databases and authentication. Spacebar cannot access any private data from Discord.com. As always, you should not provide login credentials for Discord.com, or any other service, to others.</p> Does Spacebar use the same servers as Discord? <p>No. Discord servers, as in the bare-metal running the service, are completely inaccessible to people, outside of course the Discord.com service provided. It is impossible for us to use their infrastructure. Spacebar instances are hosted entirely by their owner(s).</p> <p>If you mean Discord 'server' as in a guild, also no. Spacebar is not a proxy for Discord guilds. Spacebar does not create Discord.com accounts or ask for your own at any time (outside of OAuth features provided by the instance such as account connections or 'login with' buttons) If Spacebar was to try this, Discord's automated spam filters would surely block your instance, and ban any offending accounts.</p> <p>Lastly, you can simply view our codebase. A simple proxy would not need to be this complex or large. We implement the entire Discord.com API, Gateway, among others. None of this would be necessary if we were simply abusing Discord.com.</p> Do you use Discord.com code? <p>Absolutely not. If a potential contributor makes any indication of being a Discord employee, or to have access to leaked Discord.com code, we take measures in line with our Code of Conduct to ensure the Spacebar codebase is free of any proprietary code. We want absolutely nothing to do with it.</p> Is this illegal? <p>The Spacebar maintainers do not believe it to be, no. See: Oracle v. Google.</p> Why are you doing this, anyway? <ol> <li>We love free, open source software.</li> <li>There are many existing bots, applications, users, features, and ideas surrounding Discord.com.</li> <li>Spacebar allows these users and developers to maintain a familiar ecosystem with minimal friction.</li> <li>Reimplementing allows us to extend the Discord protocol in ways Discord.com may not deem feasible, economical, whateverical.</li> <li>This includes privacy features, such as end to end encryption for example.</li> <li>The reverse engineering effort by our team may be useful to outside developers looking to understand how similar services work.</li> <li>The Discord protocol, despite its API complexity, is quite simple and linear. No complex conflict resolution like Matrix, for example.</li> </ol> Editing the database is annoying, is there a graphical interface for this? <p>Currently no, there is no graphical interface for managing your Spacebar instance. An admin dashboard is planned, but we currently have higher priorities right now.</p> When will this feature be available? <p>We do not provide ETAs. Users tend to take them as deadlines, and for a small team of &lt;5 maintainers who do not get payment for their work, this is unreasonable.</p> It's pretty funny how you have a Discord.com guild for support. <p>We know. Also that's not a question.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Have you read the Code of Conduct?</p>"},{"location":"contributing/#style-and-a-note-on-etiquette","title":"Style and a note on etiquette","text":"<ul> <li>We use prettier for code formatting.

This route is also detailed in Discords own documentation, here specifically.</p> <p>Discord generally does not document anything that is not related to application/bot development, though.
